# The-Elements-of-Statistical-Learning-Solution
My solution for the exercises from the book 'The Elements of Statistical Learning' inform of jupyter notebook.
Each notebook is a chapter


Currently, github cannot render my notebook correctly. So please use [notebook viewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org) to view them.

Right now, I'm reading chapter 3 of the book and hope that the solution for chapter 3 will be comming soon.
